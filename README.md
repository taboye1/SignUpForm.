# SignUpForm.
Initial commit

The general idea of this SignUpForm android application is to take user's information such as name, email, password, and password confirmation then provide an appropriate text field for the user to put the above information and if the user submitted correct information and hit the button(save button), welcoming information pop out on the screen. However, if the user password and confirmation password are not the same the error message will appear on the screen.
